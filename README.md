# Advent-of-Code-Solutions
The format goes like \<Day\>P\<Problem Number\>. 
The idea is to use a different lenguage each day. 
Most solutions will be probably terrible, but I want to try it anyway.
I hope the problems will not become too hard!!

Any language may be changed to another if the problem is too hard or
I have a big skill issue. I will consider js and ts two languages
for the sake of skill issue

Probably I will not be able to do a certain language. Anyway it will
probably be skill issue. I do not like LLMs. If I cant, I cant. Anyway
LET'S GO!!!

1. ~Lua~
2. ~rust~
3. ~js~
4. ~python~
5. ~Julia~
