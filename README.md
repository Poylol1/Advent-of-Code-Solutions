# Advent-of-Code-Solutions
The format goes like \<Day\>P\<Problem Number\>. 
The idea is to use a different lenguage each day. 
Most solutions will be probably terrible, but I want to try it anyway.
I hope the problems will not become too hard!!

I have a big skill issue. I will consider js and ts two languages
for the sake of skill issue and I will most definetely repeat languages
as the late stages of the event start becomming harder

Anyway it will probably be skill issue. I do not like LLMs.
If I cant, I cant. Anyway
LET'S GO!!!

1. ~Lua~
2. ~rust~
3. ~js~
4. ~python~
5. ~Julia~
